Factors affecting accident intensity : Road accident data analysis


Abstract :
US Accidents dataset can be used for numerous applications such as real-time car accident prediction, studying car accidents hotspot locations, casualty analysis and studying the impact of precipitation or other environmental stimuli on accident occurrence. (Add-on)The recently available dataset can also be useful to study the impact of COVID-19 on traffic behavior and accidents.

Approach :
Planning to use the below classification algorithms from sklearn to predict the accident severity .
1.Logistic Regression 
2.Decision Tree
3.Random Forest
4.KNN (k- nearest neighbors)

Persona :
Can be useful for Traffic control authorities to find the most accident prone areas and take required actions.
Can be helpful for travelers and drivers to choose safest routes

Dataset : 
The dataset consists of traffic data captured by a variety of entities such as the US and State departments of transportation, law enforcement agencies, traffic cameras, and traffic sensors within the road-networks.
