# Road accident data analysis


### Abstract :
This application would offer real-time car accident prediction based on factors such as 
road conditions, weather, time of day, etc. using the US Accidents dataset.
We would offer drivers with a dashboard where they can look up the accident rate for a city,
by leveraging this historical dataset. Traffic control authorities can also benefit from the hotspot accident locations
featured in the application dashboard.

**(Add-on)** We would like to use this dataset to study the impact of COVID-19 on traffic behavior and accidents.

### Approach :
Analyze the dataset to create dashboards to understand traffic distributions in cities.
Use the below classification algorithms to predict the probability of accidents.
1.Logistic Regression 
2.Decision Tree
3.Random Forest
4.KNN (k- nearest neighbors)
Choose the model which produces the most accuracy, precision and recall.



### Persona :
1. Travelers and drivers to choose safest routes
2. Traffic control authorities to find the most accident prone areas and take required actions.


### Dataset : 
The dataset consists of traffic data captured by a variety of entities such as the US and State departments
of transportation, law enforcement agencies, traffic cameras, and traffic sensors within the road-networks.
