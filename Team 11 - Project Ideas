Idea#1. Machine Learning To Help Rural Households Access Electricity
	This application, uses historical customer payment behavior data to predict which new applicants are likely to be a good fit for their
	pay-as-you-go solar power systems program.
	Customers that make three or fewer payments in their first 180 days have a 60% chance of having their system be repossessed.
	The team built a model that could predict whether a potential customer is likely or unlikely to keep up with payments.
	


Idea#2. Discovery of materials using ML                                                                                        	
	At present, we are witnessing an explosion of marvelous works that develop and 	
	apply machine learning to real-world problems. One such state of the art is 		
	material science with machine learning. An up-growing field to discover and design 		
	new stable materials to overcome the expenses of traditional experiments and 		
	modelling that consume tremendous time and resources at hand.


Idea#3. Live tracking of location and quality of food in real-time
	In this application, we can know the estimated delivery time/precise 
	location of the order and we could possibly know the level of quality of
	the products in real-time.
	We can work on this using blockchain technology. We can also try to meet the two 
	endpoints that are the farmer and consumer which is similar to farmer connect.
