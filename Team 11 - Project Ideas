Idea#1. Find the Dish!
        These days, it is common for people to post photos of a dish that they
        love in a social media platform such as instagram. However, some of the
        posts do not have information such as the name of the dish and
        the restaurant.
        We would like to solve this problem by building an ML model that could
        identify the name of the dish from its picture.We plan to supplement
        this feature by providing the list of nearby restaurants where this dish
        or similar is available, and if possible, get the reviews for the dish
        in each of these locations.


Idea#2. Discovery of materials using ML                                                                                        	
	At present, we are witnessing an explosion of marvelous works that develop and 		
	apply machine learning to real-world problems. One such state of the art is 		
	material science with machine learning. An up-growing field to discover and design 		
	new stable materials to overcome the expenses of traditional experiments and 		
	modelling that consume tremendous time and resources at hand.


Idea#3. Topic: Live tracking of location and quality of food in real-time
	In this application, we can know the estimated delivery time/precise 
	location of the order and we could possibly know the level of quality of
	the products in real-time.
	We can work on this using blockchain technology. We can also try to meet the two 
	endpoints that are the farmer and consumer which is similar to farmer connect.
